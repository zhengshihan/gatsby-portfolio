          Hi there! I'm Shihan Zheng, an enthusiastic amateur photographer and
          aspiring software developer. By day, I dive into the world of code,
          exploring new technologies and building exciting projects. By night, I
          love to capture the beauty around me using just my phone. This blog is
          a space where I share my journey, from coding tutorials and tech
          insights to stunning photos and personal stories. Whether you're here
          for the tech tips or to enjoy some photography, I hope you find
          something that inspires you. Thanks for stopping by!
